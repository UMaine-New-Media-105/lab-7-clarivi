This is a Lab Exercise done on 3/29 for the New Media 105 Creative Coding course. The lab consists of 3 exercises.

The first exercise had us creating a diagonal X of shapes, and then using a random function to assign random colors to them. An important caveat of this is involving p5js's 'noLoop()' function to prevent the shapes from constantly changing colors. I chose the colors of the Irish flag and the ideally blue sky behind it.

The second exercise involved recreating a grid of shapes that we made earlier in the semester, but this time with nested loops. This shows how far we have come in understanding Computer Science principles, as we can use loops and variables to draw a grid of 100 squares in just a few lines of code. We also had to add a color gradient that changed as the shapes were drawn.

The third exercise was to improve upon the remade grid of shapes and add some mouse interactivity. In my case, I added the intensity of the gradient changing as your mouse moved across the screen, in both the X and Y directions. I also had the primary color of the gradient change from blue to yellow while the mouse was held down.
